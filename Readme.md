This is a project that I have worked on on Smart city challenge hackathon in Split. The idea is that application would run on some screens in city buses, it will show 
current bus location on the map, all bus stations that bus stops on, time of arrival for every bus station, some ads, weather conditions and time. Current location is 
updating when the bus moves and weather conditions are also updating every 5 seconds depending on your current location.
